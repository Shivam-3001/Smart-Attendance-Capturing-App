Problem Statement
It is required to develop a smart attendance capturing mobile app with following features: 1. It should capture basic details of employees like Photograph (headshot), Name, Designation, Employee Number, Gender, Office Address, etc. 2. It should recognize the employee by face while capturing the attendance (entry) through face recognition and enter the relevant details including entry time in the system after successful face recognition. Similarly, while exiting the office premises, employee will be recognized using his/her face and exit time will be entered in the system. 3. The app should automatically capture the GPS location where the attendance is being taken and allow capturing the attendance only in a geo-fenced area (100 meters within LATITUDE/LONGITUDE) the office premises. Otherwise, the app should automatically exit. 4. The app should successfully work for any specific employees with or without wearing spectacles, cap or industrial helmet.
